## Make a Resource

This is the lightweight way to create a Resource without generating via Scaffolding, which creates a whole bunch of files and code that are not all necessary.

1. In console, `rails g model {post} title:string description:text`
2. In console, `rake db:migrate`
3. Update `config/routes.db` add the new resource `resources :posts`
4. Add a `root 'posts#index'` to the `config/routes.rb` (or whatever root path you want)
5. Go to localhost:3000 and you will get an error. You need a Controller
6. In console, `rails g controller Posts`. Make sure the resource is capitalized and pluralized
7. Refresh localhost. Missing template.
8. Go to app/view/posts and create file index.html.erb
9. Add a link to create new resource `<%= link_to "New Post", new_post_path %>`
10. Create `new.html.erb` view for resource
11. Update all the resource Controller stuff
